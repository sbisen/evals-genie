EvalsGenie, a company on a mission to simplify and scale agentic products evaluation, is excited to introduce EvalsGenie — a domain-aware, no-code AI evaluation platform that empowers enterprise teams to validate AI agents across departments like Finance, DevOps, Ads, and Engineering.
EvalsGenie helps AI teams generate evaluation question sets, recommended metrics, and production-readiness decision boards — all tailored to the context of their domain. Built for both technical and non-technical users, EvalsGenie makes scalable agent evaluation finally achievable.

"Agent deployments are growing fast, but the evaluation process hasn't caught up. It's still manual, inconsistent, and siloed," said [Slarra], [CEO] at EvalsGenie. "EvalsGenie is the magical assistant that helps teams validate agent readiness — in context, at scale, without writing a line of code.

FAQs
What exactly is EvalsGenie?
EvalsGenie is a domain-specific AI evaluation platform that generates tailored eval sets, metrics, and production-readiness dashboards for AI agents. It enables scalable, accurate agent evaluation across departments in an enterprise.
Why was EvalsGenie created?
Enterprises are deploying agents across teams — but evaluating them is still a manual, inconsistent process. The eval process gets slow with outdated test sets because the AI team is smaller compared to the agentic product demand in multiple departments. Every domain (finance, DevOps, ads) has unique expectations. EvalsGenie automates evaluation generation with domain context in mind, helping teams validate agents faster and smarter.
How is EvalsGenie different from other evaluation tools?
Most tools are generic, code-heavy, or lack domain awareness. EvalsGenie:
Accepts user stories, prompts, and RAG context as inputs
Auto-generates evaluation questions tailored to the use case
Recommends the right metrics per domain
Provides a production readiness decision board
Is usable by non-engineers through a clean no-code UI
Specialized product just for the Eval ecosystem at the enterprise level
How do teams get started?
Simple onboarding — just upload:
Agent input/output samples
User stories
Prompt or code (optional)
RAG context documents or key terms
1–3 sample Q&A pairs
Then, EvalsGenie generates:
Domain-specific eval questions
Suggested metrics
A production readiness dashboard
How does EvalsGenie handle data privacy and security?
EvalsGenie prioritizes data protection. EvalsGenie offers:
End-to-end encryption (data in transit and at rest)
Secure handling of all uploaded documents
Support for private cloud or on-prem deployments for enterprises
